        "\n",
        "####**The Challenge**\n",
        "\n",
        "The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n",
        "\n",
        "On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n",
        "\n",
        "While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n",
        "\n",
        "*In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “**what sorts of people were more likely to survive?**” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).*\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **What Data Will I Use in This Competition?**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Evaluation**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Goal**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.\n",
        "  For each in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.\n",
        "2. **Metric**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification).\n",
        "3. **Submission File Format**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The file should have exactly 2 columns:\n",
        "  - PassengerId (sorted in any order)\n",
        "  - Survived (contains your binary predictions: `1` for survived, `0` for deceased)\n",
        "    \n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    PassengerId,Survived\n",
        "    892,0\n",
        "    893,1\n",
        "    894,0\n",
        "    Etc.\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  You can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the Data page.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Data** \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "The data has been split into two groups:\n",
        "- training set (`train.csv`)\n",
        "- test set (`test.csv`)\n",
        "\n",
        "The **training set** should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like `passengers’` `gender` and `class`. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **test set** should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also include `gender_submission.csv`, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.\n",
        "\n",
